# Bus Ticketing App Frontend

Welcome to the frontend directory of the Bus Ticketing App! This directory contains all the files and resources related to the user interface and client-side logic of our application.
Overview

Our Bus Ticketing App frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We've chosen React.js for its component-based architecture, which allows us to create reusable UI elements and manage state efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend development of our Bus Ticketing App, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the Git repository of the Bus - - Ticketing App to your local machine:

`git clone git@github.com:Management3/Bus-ticket-.git`

- Navigate to the Frontend Directory: Navigate to the frontend directory of the cloned repository:

`cd Bus-ticket-/frontend`

- Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend using npm or yarn:

`npm install`

### or

`yarn install`

Start the Development Server: Start the development server to run the frontend application locally:

`npm start`

### or

`yarn start`

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Directory Structure

The frontend directory of our Bus Ticketing App follows a typical structure for React.js applications:

    public/: Contains the static assets and the HTML template file (index.html) used by the React application.
    src/: Contains the source code of the React components, styles, and other frontend logic.
        components/: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
        pages/: Contains the main page components of the application, each representing a different view or route.
        styles/: Contains CSS or SCSS files for styling the application.
        App.js: The main component that serves as the entry point of the application.
        index.js: The JavaScript file that renders the root component (App) into the HTML document.
